# 🏡 California Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is part of the **Machine Learning Crash Course** under the *International Institute of Medical Science & Technology Council (IIMSTC)*. The goal is to build and deploy a supervised regression model using the **California Housing dataset** to predict median house prices based on location and housing features.

---

## 🔍 Project Summary

We trained a regression model using **Linear Regression** on the California Housing dataset available in `scikit-learn`. After training and evaluation, we deployed the model using **Streamlit** to allow users to interactively predict housing prices.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📊 Real-time predictions using user inputs  
- 📈 Evaluation metrics displayed (MAE, RMSE, R² Score)  
- 🧠 Feature importance bar chart for interpretability  
- 💻 Deployed locally via Streamlit

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Source:** `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing()`
- **Features Used:**  
  - MedInc, HouseAge, AveRooms, AveBedrms, Population, AveOccup, Latitude, Longitude
